// The canary for check-traceability.mjs, in the spirit of the backend's BanListNegativeControlTest and migration-fixtures/:
// a gate that would pass over anything is not a gate, and a traceability gate is the easy shape to get wrong
// that way -- tighten a regex by one character and it stops matching, reports nothing, and reads green.
//
// So every failure class the gate claims gets a fixture that exhibits exactly it, and this script asserts two
// things per fixture: the exit status, and that the offending token appears in the output. A defect the gate
// misses fails here. The passing fixtures are the other half of the control: a gate that fails on everything
// is no more useful than one that fails on nothing.
//
// The fixtures live in fixtures/traceability/<case>/ and are excluded from the gate's own default scan by
// explicit path, because they are deliberately full of the defects it catches. Nothing in this file spells a
// bare requirement id literally either -- the ids are assembled from parts, so this script needs no exemption.
//
// One case cannot be a committed fixture and is built instead; see `deletedTrackedFileCase` at the end.
//
// `scripts/wall-checks.txt` runs this before the gate itself, from the project root. Node, standard library
// only, 22 or newer. Needs git on PATH for the built case.
