// Spec ids and the code cite each other, and until this gate nothing read either direction. The spec files
// under `specs/<NNN>-<name>/spec.md` define requirement ids as bullets -- `- **FR-nnn**: ...` and
// `- **SC-nnn**: ...` -- the ids are per feature and they collide across features (every feature here defines
// an FR whose number is 001), so a citation written bare names nothing: it resolves to four different
// requirements at once and to none of them in particular. The one citation form outside a feature's own spec
// directory is therefore qualified: `NNN/FR-nnn` / `NNN/SC-nnn`, where NNN is the feature directory's numeric
// prefix. (Spelled with placeholders, here and everywhere below: this file sits inside the gate's own scan
// root, so a qualified example written with real digits would have to resolve against a feature that
// happens to exist -- and it would stop resolving in a project that has no specs tree yet.) The legacy spelling with a space instead of the slash counts as bare, because a
// reader and a grep both have to guess whether the number in front is a feature or a sentence.
//
// What this gate reads:
//   a. no bare id anywhere in the scan roots, so every citation names exactly one requirement;
//   b. every qualified citation resolves -- the feature directory exists and its spec.md defines that id;
//   b2. inside `specs/<NNN>-<name>/` a bare id is legal, because there it means that feature's own -- so it
//      has to be one that feature's spec.md actually defines. A reference to another feature's id is written
//      qualified there as everywhere else, and the legacy spaced form fails there too: `NNN FR-nnn` inside a
//      feature directory reads either as that feature's own id or as a cross-reference, and a reader cannot
//      tell which. This is the check that found the ids 004's own spec cites and no spec.md defines -- see
//      the `Ids inside a feature directory` section it prints;
//   c. every requirement of a *complete* feature is cited from at least one file under a test root, or is
//      waived with a written reason;
//   d. the waiver file is well formed and carries no waiver that is no longer needed. A waiver row is three
//      columns -- `NNN/ID<TAB>kind<TAB>reason` -- because "no test cites this" has exactly two honest causes
//      and they are not the same fact. `external` means the criterion cannot be witnessed from inside this
//      repository at all: a consumer service's behaviour, the caller topology, a production baseline, an
//      organisational outcome. No test here could ever close it, so it is closed by the reason. `deferred`
//      means the requirement is specified and deliberately not built yet, and its reason has to name where
//      that deferral is written down -- a named-gap row in docs/GATES.md, a scope boundary in the feature's
//      plan.md, the owning capability -- so a reader can go and check that the deferral is real. The two are
//      kept apart because the deferred set is a debt this repo owes and the external set is not, so `--report`
//      prints the deferred ids as a list of their own at the end. A requirement that is merely untested is
//      neither: it gets a test;
//   e. the legacy-file list is well formed and carries no row that is no longer needed;
//   f. the spec tree itself is sane -- a feature directory has a spec.md, it defines at least one id, no id
//      is defined twice inside one spec, and no two feature directories share one NNN;
//   g. every requirement of a feature that has a `tasks.md` is named by some task in it, or waived.
//
// Why a *foreign-qualified* token is recognised and then ignored. A requirement id qualified by something
// that is not a feature prefix -- `<QUALIFIER>/FR-nnn`, where the qualifier is an uppercase letter followed
// by uppercase letters, digits and hyphens -- names a requirement of some other document: a capability block
// in another repository, a standard, a vendor's numbering. Features 001..004 here were specified from
// documents in another repository and their specs are full of such tokens; `specs/upstream/` keeps those
// documents as read-only history, and its README says so. This repo no longer takes specs from anywhere:
// a domain expert writes `specs/<NNN>-<name>/spec.md` here, so nothing outside is declared, pinned or
// resolved, and such a token is *prose*. It is not a citation, it resolves nothing, it covers nothing, it
// needs no declaration, and it is not a bare id.
//
// That the shape is still recognised is the whole point, and it is what makes the omission fail *closed*.
// The other document numbers its requirements in exactly this repo's spelling, so its `FR-nnn` and a local
// `FR-nnn` are two requirements wearing one name. Were the classifier simply dropped, `<QUALIFIER>/FR-nnn`
// would be read as the bare id `FR-nnn`, and inside a feature directory a bare id means *that feature's own*
// -- so it would resolve, silently, against a local requirement it has nothing to do with, and it would
// count as a task naming that requirement. Recognised and dropped, it counts as nothing anywhere: a test
// that cites only `<QUALIFIER>/FR-nnn` leaves the local id of that number uncovered, and a task line that
// names only `<QUALIFIER>/FR-nnn` leaves the local id unplanned. The qualifier grammar starts with a letter,
// so a qualifier can never be read as a three-digit feature prefix nor a feature prefix as a qualifier.
//
// `specs/upstream/` is skipped by every pass that reads citations. Those documents' ids are their own,
// written bare in their own prose; reading them would turn every requirement another repository wrote into a
// bare id this repo has to answer for, which is the opposite of the truth. Nothing in that directory is a
// claim this repo makes, and nothing gates it.
//
// Why spec -> tasks is gated as well. A requirement nothing plans is a requirement nothing builds, and the
// coverage check above cannot see it: it reads tests, and an unplanned requirement has no test to be missing
// from until the feature closes. So every id of a feature that has a `tasks.md` is named by some task there
// -- bare, since a task file sits inside its own feature directory, or qualified -- or carries a waiver row.
// `plan.md` and commit messages are deliberately left ungated: the plan is prose about the approach and the
// commit log is not an input to anything.
//
// Why a legacy-file list exists at all. A shipped Flyway migration is append-only (R-16,
// check-migrations-append-only.mjs), so the bare ids inside `V2`..`V8` cannot be rewritten into the qualified
// form without moving a checksum Flyway validates at the first deploy against an existing database. Those
// files are listed once, with a reason, and their bare ids are ignored entirely rather than silently
// tolerated everywhere.
//
// What this gate cannot read is printed on every run, pass or fail: a citation is a *claim* that a test
// covers a requirement, and no static check can tell a claim from a coverage. See the block at the end.
//
// What this gate reads is the working tree, never the index. A default scan root is *listed* with
// `git ls-files`, which reads the index, so a tracked file deleted from the working tree is listed and is not
// there -- the shape a fresh scaffold has between removing a directory and staging that removal. Such a path
// is skipped: a file that is not on disk carries no citations, so there is nothing to read and nothing to
// claim. Absence alone is skipped; a file that is there and unreadable is a verdict the gate cannot reach and
// fails it, naming the path.
//
// Layout. This script sits in `<project root>/scripts/`, installed there by scalith's `init-pipeline`, and the
// project root is its parent directory. The specs tree is `<project root>/specs`. The default scan roots are
// the project's tracked files under `backend/` (the vendored java-backend-template), `frontend/`,
// `.specify/memory/` and `scripts/`, each one that exists; the test roots are `backend/src/test` and whatever
// frontendTestRoots() returns. With no specs tree the gate still runs, with zero defined ids -- so every
// citation is dangling and every bare id still fails -- and says it found no specs directory. The project's
// backend wall runs it: `backend/scripts/wall.mjs` runs each script `scripts/wall-checks.txt` lists, and that
// list names this gate's self-test and then this gate.
//
// Caveats this gate cannot reach, beyond the ones it prints on every run (a citation is a claim, not a
// verification; user stories, acceptance scenarios and edge cases carry no ids; a foreign-qualified token is
// decided on in no direction; a foreign requirement written bare is read as the feature's own and is caught
// only while its number defines nothing locally):
//   - A range spelled with an en dash (`FR-nnn–nnn`, `FR-nnn–FR-nnn`) is not parsed. Only a fully spelled
//     endpoint is a token, so every id between the two ends is invisible in both directions; a range of ids
//     is written out id by id.
//   - A file listed in `specs/trace-legacy-files.tsv` has its bare ids ignored entirely: the exemption is per
//     file, not per id. The list exists for a file whose text can no longer be rewritten, a shipped migration
//     above all, whose checksum Flyway validates against an existing database.
//   - `plan.md` and commit messages are deliberately ungated.
//   - Neither list under `specs/` (`trace-waivers.tsv`, `trace-legacy-files.tsv`) is shipped or required: each
//     is optional to the gate, and the first feature that needs a row is what creates it.
//   - The default scan roots are listed with `git ls-files`, so an untracked file is not scanned until it is
//     added. CI scans after the commit.
//
// Rules this gate implements: guardrails-toolchain *A guardrail is a tool whose verdict fails a build by
// itself*, *Record the caveat that bites*, *Assign each defect class to the earliest layer that can own it*;
// enforceable-rules *Machine-enforced or it is not a rule*, *Deterministic output from committed inputs*, *Gates
