# Constitution

<!-- Installed by scalith's `init-pipeline` into a project created by `/new-java-backend`, before
     `specify init --here`, which seeds this file only when it is missing, so it survives initialisation.
     Articles I–VI stay as they are: they restate what the vendored java-backend-template in `backend/`
     already enforces and are not open for re-planning per feature. Article VII is optional and starts empty;
     running `/speckit-constitution` is not a step of starting the project. -->

## Article I. The platform is decided

Java 25, Spring Boot Web MVC, jOOQ over PostgreSQL 18, Flyway, Jackson, Maven. Exact version pins. These are
not re-planned per feature; a plan's Technical Context inherits them. Changing one is its own change, with
the reason and the date recorded in `pom.xml`.

## Article II. The gates are the review

Code here is written by agents and read line by line by nobody. `mvn verify` in `backend/` is the definition of done and
every check in it fails the build on its own: the compile wall (Error Prone, NullAway, JSpecify), the
formatter, the executable ban list with its coverage and negative-control meta-tests, the layering test,
the migration lint, the error-catalog and OpenAPI snapshots, the integration suite against a real
PostgreSQL, the coverage floor, the licence allowlist. `docs/GATES.md` maps each gate to the skill directive
it implements and names what no gate reaches.

## Article III. Explicit over silent

Transactions are visible `tx.*` blocks. Dependencies arrive through constructors. Time comes from the
injected `Clock`. Ids are UUIDv7 from one producer. Money is the `Money` type and every rounding names its
mode. Logging goes through one typed facade with a catalogued event name. Anything that would make
behaviour happen outside the program text (`@Transactional`, `@Scheduled`, `@Cacheable`, a Java agent, an
attached jOOQ record, a `ThreadLocal` cache) is banned and the ban is a test.

## Article IV. The contract is a committed document

One OpenAPI document per major version, generated from the code, normalized by the repo's own normalizer,
diffed on every build. Every error is an RFC 9457 problem with a machine `code` from a compile-checked
catalog that is itself snapshotted. Pagination is keyset only. `PATCH` does not exist.

An identifier travels in the path only: no request body carries a member named after a path variable, not
even an optional echo. Each operation binds its own request type, and an update body declares only the
fields that operation writes. A requirement that an attempt to change X is refused is met by X's absence
from the update body, which the strict body reader refuses (`validation.identifier-in-path`,
`validation.unknown-field`); never by declaring X and comparing it, and never with a `*-immutable` code.

## Article V. One repo, one service, one micro-frontend

The service lives under `backend/` and is API-only. The micro-frontend lives under `frontend/`, builds to
static assets and deploys separately; the service never serves it. The two share one contract,
`backend/openapi/v1.json`, and one CI, whose `backend` and `frontend` jobs are both required on `main`.
The frontend's mechanism for being loaded by a shell is decided when a shell exists, at one named
exposure point, and nowhere else.

## Article VI. Features are packages

A feature is one package under the base package. It owns its migrations, its error catalog, its service, its
controller and its integration test. It depends on the platform tier and the generated jOOQ tables, and on
another feature only through that feature's `api` package itself, never a subpackage of it, along an edge listed
as one `caller -> callee` line in the backend's allowed feature map, `LayeringArchTest.ALLOWED_FEATURE_DEPENDENCIES`,
which starts empty. No chain of edges returns to its start: a cycle between features fails whatever the map says.
A plan for a spec that needs another feature names each edge and the callee's types it calls; the edge is a plan
decision, never a constitution amendment. The implementation puts those types in the callee's `api` package and
adds the map line in the same commit as the call, removes the line in the commit that removes the last call, and
never edits the boundary test.
It owns its tables: only it writes them, and a method that writes may name no other feature's table. Any feature
may read another's tables through the generated jOOQ tables, in a method that starts no write, or through the
owner's `api` package along a mapped edge.
One feature package is the worked shape at any time and `backend/CLAUDE.md` names it; copy its shape. The
template's sample package is deleted by the first real feature and is never the shape again.

## Article VII. Project-specific articles

None. Empty is a complete state for this section: no command, gate or test reads whether it is filled, and
nothing is owed here. A project article is added only by amendment, as Governance says, when a rule turns out
to bind more than one feature and names the test or gate that holds it.

## Governance

Amendments are commits to this file with the reason in the message; the file carries no version number, and
the commit is the record. Articles I–VI change only when the template in `backend/` changes what it enforces,
never for one feature. Article VII is the project's own, and a rule is admitted to it only when it binds two or
more feature packages, or a table or package the proposing feature does not own, and names the test or gate that
holds it; a rule about one feature's own tables, columns, endpoints or error codes is a plan decision, recorded
in that feature's plan and `docs/GATES.md`. A gate is removed only together with the directive it implemented
being retired in the skills repo, never because it is inconvenient.
